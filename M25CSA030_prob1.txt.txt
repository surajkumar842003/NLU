The chatbot developed in this assignment is entirely based on regular expressions and simple string processing. During interaction, the chatbot feels partially natural when the user provides inputs that match the expected patterns. For example, when the user enters a date of birth in a supported format such as “12-08-2002” or “12 August 2002”, the chatbot successfully extracts the date and calculates the age correctly. In such cases, the response appears smooth and gives the impression of basic conversational ability.

Similarly, the chatbot responds reasonably well when asked about the user’s mood. Inputs like “I am happy”, “feeling sad today”, or even slightly misspelled words such as “happpy” are correctly identified using flexible regular expressions. This makes the interaction feel somewhat natural for simple, keyword-based responses. Another example is surname detection: when the user enters a full name such as “Suraj Kumar Singh”, the chatbot correctly identifies “Singh” as the surname, which works well for structured name inputs.

However, the chatbot often feels unnatural when the user deviates from predefined input formats. For instance, if the user says “I was born sometime in early 2000s”, the chatbot fails to detect the birthday because the sentence does not match any specific regex pattern. Similarly, when a mood is expressed indirectly, such as “Today has been exhausting and frustrating”, the chatbot may not respond appropriately, as it does not truly understand the meaning of the sentence.

One of the main strengths of regex-based interaction is its simplicity and predictability. The chatbot gives consistent responses for known patterns and does not require training data or computational resources. This makes it efficient and easy to control. For structured tasks like detecting dates, extracting names, or matching common mood keywords, regular expressions are highly effective and reliable.

Despite these advantages, the limitations are significant. The chatbot cannot understand context, cannot remember previous interactions, and cannot generalize beyond the patterns it was programmed for. For example, if the user asks a follow-up question related to a previous response, the chatbot treats it as a completely new input. It also fails in ambiguous or creative language scenarios and cannot handle complex spelling errors or synonyms.
